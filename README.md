A simple FiveM resource built for QBCore and Qbx framework ( qb-core and qbx_core ). 
This script can work with either ' QB ' or ' OX ' inventory, target and inventory.
It also comes with an easy config.lua.

This is my first script, there may be issues. Feel free to join the discord as I will be making more scripts and making a Tebex store - hopefully. xD
